# Mars-JGR-2017
This Matlab code is to facilitate the use and interpretation of the Mars crustal magnetic field models included in supplementary information of:

Moore, K.M. & Bloxham, J. (2017). The construction of sparse models of Marsâ€™ crustal magnetic field. JGR Planets. DOI: 10.1002/2016JE005238

Use of these files should cite the above reference. 

File descriptions:
1. test_plotting1.m  --> this file shows how to use the coordinates, mesh, and models included in the suppplementary information.
2. calcGreensFunction_weighted_correct_areas.m --> this function calculates a Green's function to upward continue my Mars magnetic field models from the planet's surface (defined here as 3393.5km) to arbitrary points of the user's choice.
